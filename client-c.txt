Task C: Product Package Counter
Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

Hint: Loops

set an items variable to 0
items = 0
# add products to case to 50 max
while products < 50
    # scan package 
    products=products + 2
    print "number of products is" + products
end while loop
print "case is full"
